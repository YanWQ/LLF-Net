# Datasets
We have created a large-scale wide-baseline light field dataset (called WLF), which is originally created for training and testing the deep learning-based models for depth estimation. You might use this dataset for other purpose if possible. Please feel free to download our dataset, consisting of <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3931237#.XwTVNxT7SaE">Part I</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3934712#.XwTTWRT7SaE">Part II</a> and  <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4556058#.YDQgqOj0mCo">Part III</a>
